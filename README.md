# IceWMCP (Ice Window Manager Control Panel)

This fork serves as a continuation of the original IceWM Control Panel, created to modernize
and resume its development. The control panel integrates several open source components to
provide an easy and comprehensive configuration tool for IceWM.

## Status

**The codebase is currently undergoing a major overhaul from its original Python 2 codebase
and is not in a runnable state.** The immediate focus is on reorganizing the software into
a more modern and maintainable structure.

## Acknowledgments

This would not be possible without the foundational work of its original authors:

*   **Erica Andrews (PhrozenSmoke):** Main author and integrator of the IceWM Control Panel.
*   **David Mortensen:** Original author of IcePref2.
*   **Dirk Moebius & Mike Hostler:** Original authors of IceMe.
