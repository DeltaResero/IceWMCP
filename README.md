# IceWMCP (Ice Window Manager Control Panel)

This fork serves as a continuation of the original IceWM Control Panel, created to modernize
and resume its development. The control panel integrates several open source components to
provide a comprehensive graphical configuration tool for Ice Window Manager (IceWM).

## Status

**The codebase is currently undergoing a major overhaul from its original Python 2 codebase
and is not in a runnable state.** The immediate focus is on reorganizing the software into
a more modern and maintainable structure.

## Acknowledgments

This would not be possible without the foundational work of its original authors:

*   **Erica Andrews (PhrozenSmoke):** Main author and integrator of the IceWM Control Panel.
*   **David Mortensen:** Original author of IcePref2.
*   **Dirk Moebius & Mike Hostler:** Original authors of IceMe.
