VERSION 3.0pre - 10/15/2003 - 12/6/2003

The focus of this release is to provide an official PyGtk-2/Gtk-2 port of all applications.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
	All applications in the control panel now use the PyGtk-2/Gtk-2 user
	interface libraries.  The new PyGtk-2 port includes mostly restructured 
	code from version 2.5, but also includes code snippets and suggestions 
	from David Moore's donated, experimental PyGtk-2 port for IceWMP 
	version 2.3.  Tarball installation packages are now using the new version 
	0.4 of PyInstallShield (recently ported to PyGtk-2). The GdkImlib image 
	loading module is no longer be used, and all image loading is being 
	down through gtk.Image and gdkpixbuf.


PangoXLFD        (pangoxlfd.py):
	- New internal, non-GUI module added to handle the new Gtk-2 Font Selection Dialog's 'font description' format. 	Some tricks had to be done to convert to/from the XLFD font strings needed by IceWM and the new "font description" format used by Pango and Gtk-2 font selection dialogs.  This module serves as a bridge between XLFD font descriptions and Pango's rebellion against an established standard.


IceWMCP         (IceWMCP.py):
	- Version is now 3.0
	- The application has been ported to PyGtk-2/Gtk-2.
	- The application now offers a built-in window icon (which, of course, can be changed in IceWM)


IceWMCP-Common        (icewmcp_common.py):
	- Version is now 3.0
	- The application has been ported to PyGtk-2/Gtk-2.
	- All applications now import module 'pygtk' and call 'pygtk.require("2.0")
	- David Moore (djm6202['at']yahoo.co.nz) has been officially added to the credits for his work creating the first prototype of a PyGtk-2 port for IceWMCP, from which many of the code snippets and ideas for the official PyGtk-2 port originate.
	- Several methods have been added, removed, and redesigned to accommodate PyGtk-2.
	- On Vasya's [Vasiliy Leushin (basileus['at']newmail.ru) ] suggestion, the default fonts for Russian are now Arial, instead of Helvetica.  (If he says Arial was working on his system, I'll believe him.)
	- The freely available CJKCodecs for Python will now be used for all unicode conversions for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean languages.  Currently this only affects Traditional Chinese (zh_tw).  Traditional Chinese users will need to download and install the CJKCodecs if they do not already have them: http://cjkpython.berlios.de/ , since Python does not appear to natively support charsets lil Big-5, etc.
	- Added a built-in default pixmap 'icon_icewmcp' and methods 'set_basic_window_icon' and  'set_special_window_icon' used by all applications for setting default window icons, which IceWM of course allows you to change as you please


IceWMCP-EnergyStar         (IceWMCPEnergyStar.py):
	- Version is now 3.0
	- The application has been ported to PyGtk-2/Gtk-2.
	- The application now offers a built-in window icon (which, of course, can be changed in IceWM)


IceSoundManager        (icesound.py):
	- Version is now 3.0


IcePref2       (icepref.py):
	- Version is now 3.2
	- The application has been ported to PyGtk-2/Gtk-2.
	- Tearoff menus have been disabled due to a seg-fault I kept experiencing in PyGtk 2.0.0.  All of my apps were seg-faulting when Tearoff menus were clicked.  I don't know if this is a bug in PyGtk-2, or what, but I refuse to leave a feature in that's causing a known seg-fault.
	- The 'Run As Root' CheckButton on the 'File' menu has been replaced with an appropriate 'CheckMenuItem' object
	- The 'sample' text now has line breaks
	- Some tricks had to be done to convert to/from the XLFD font strings needed by IceWM and the new "font description" format used by Pango and Gtk-2 font selection dialogs: The Font selection widgets now rely on the new module 'pangoxlfd'
	- Since Gtk-2 font selection dialogs are no longer returning and accepting XLFD-style font strings like '-adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-*-140-*-*-*-*-*-*', and Gtk-2 leaves you with NO way of getting such strings from a font dialog, all we can do is hope the home-spun conversion library 'pangoxlfd' does its job; however, this may create some bugs in font selection for some users. Sorry.  I tried putting Pango-style 'font descriptions' like "Arial 12" in the IceWM preferences file: It does not work!  So, we have to use XLFD font descriptions.
	- Feature enhancement: When IcePref2 starts or a new preferences file is opened, the currently configured IceWM theme is now actually selected and scrolled to in the Themes section.
	- Drag-and-drop color support no longer requires the hidden ColorSelection window which had been used for so long; DND color support now handles 'application/x-color' items using the Python 'binascii' module and some other tricks
	- Fixed a bug where clicking on a color selection button could result in an uncaught TraceBack error if the color specified in the text entry was not a valid color; The color selection dialog should now always open regardless of what has been typed in the text entry
	- The text entry in the Font selection widgets now only updates the sample text for the font after the Enter/Return key is pressed, instead of updating the font everytime a keystroke was made in the text entry field.
	- The IcePref2 logo is now slightly smaller
	- Improved scaling of the sample wallpaper image in the Desktop section
	- The application now offers a built-in window icon (which, of course, can be changed in IceWM)


IcePref2-TD            (icepref_td.py):
	- Version is now 3.0
	- The application has been ported to PyGtk-2/Gtk-2.
	- Tearoff menus have been disabled due to a seg-fault I kept experiencing in PyGtk 2.0.0.  All of my apps were seg-faulting when Tearoff menus were clicked.  I don't know if this is a bug in PyGtk-2, or what, but I refuse to leave a feature in that's causing a known seg-fault.

PhrozenClock  (phrozenclock.py):
	- Version is now 3.0
	- The application has been ported to PyGtk-2/Gtk-2.
	- The use of Gtk 'timeouts' is now more memory friendly, updating only things that need to be updated.
	- The time zone list now only shows half of the list of available time zones at a time: Up/Down scroll arrows now appear next to the drop-down list of time zones allowing you to show the first half or the last half. Since many systems have upwards of 2,000 time zones available on the system, we don't want to overwhelm the GtkCombo widget by trying to display all at once.  Users should notice a smoother scrolling, faster drop-down list of time zones
	- Two new translatable strings added; 2 new Spanish translations added.
	- The application now offers a built-in window icon (which, of course, can be changed in IceWM)
	- Application has now been assigned WM_CLASS and WM_NAME values


IceWMCP-Wallpaper    (IceWMCPWallpaper.py):
	- Version is now 3.0
	- The application has been ported to PyGtk-2/Gtk-2.
	- The 'Run As Root' CheckButton on the 'File' menu has been replaced with an appropriate 'CheckMenuItem' object

	- Fixed a bug where clicking on a color selection button could result in an uncaught TraceBack error if the color specified in the text entry was not a valid color; The color selection dialog should now always open regardless of what has been typed in the text entry
	- Feature enhancement: Now your selected background color can be previewed underneath whatever wallpaper you've selected on the IceWMCP-Wallpaper's 'preview monitor'; this is especially helpful if the wallpaper you are using has transparency
	- User interface improvements: The 'directory' field has been moved up to the right of the 'Color' field, resulting in alot of saved screen space.
	- Keyboard support improvements: Typing a color in the 'Color' field and pressing Enter now updates the selected color; Typing a directory in the 'Directory' field and pressing Enter now updates the directory being browsed
	- Improvements when switching between normal mode and 'Run as Root': appropriate wallpapers, colors, and directories are loaded
	- The width of the image list has been increased to aid in easier reading of long file names
	- More efficient image loading and scaling, resulting in noticeable speed improvements
	- When the application starts up, your selected wallpaper is now correctly selected and scrolled to in the list  (not sure what took me so long to remember to fix this)

TODO     (My personal reminders - pay no attention to the woman behind the curtain):  
	- It seems Petteri abandoned the Finnish translations...he did IceMe only and quit - would anybody like to complete the rest? (I know, wishful thinking)
	- PRIORITY: Speed up IceMe start-up (play with speed of icon loading)
	- PhrozenClock:  Find a way to read and understand /etc/localtime even if its a 'hard file' instead of a symlink: This means we have to learn to read glibc's binary format for zoneinfo data, if possible  (8.25.2003 - still needs to be researched)
	- PhrozenClock:  Is there a need to support multiple 'localtime' and 'timezone' file locations for PhrozenClock? Do some systems use more than one location for these files and need them 'synched'?  (8.25.2003 - still needs to be researched)
	- New control panel applet under consideration:  Some type of 'font manager' or third-party font tool???  ...maybe hard to implement 'uniform' font installation under X, but at least an applet for viewing installed fonts??
