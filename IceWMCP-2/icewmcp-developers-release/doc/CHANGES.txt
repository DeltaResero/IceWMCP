TODO     (My personal reminders - pay no attention to the woman behind the curtain):  
	- Update/fix PyInstallShield
	- See if we can get help from other users to finish the French translation Yves Perraudin started; also, can we get somebody to do a set of French applets and Help files?
	- It seems Petteri abandoned the Finnish translations...he did IceMe only and quit - would anybody like to complete the rest? (I know, wishful thinking)
	- PhrozenClock:  Find a way to read and understand /etc/localtime even if its a 'hard file' instead of a symlink: This means we have to learn to read glibc's binary format for zoneinfo data, if possible  (8.25.2003 - still needs to be researched)
	- PhrozenClock:  Is there a need to support multiple 'localtime' and 'timezone' file locations for PhrozenClock? Do some systems use more than one location for these files and need them 'synched'?  (8.25.2003 - still needs to be researched)
	- New control panel applet under consideration:  Some type of 'font manager' or third-party font tool???  ...maybe hard to implement 'uniform' font installation under X, but at least an applet for viewing installed fonts??
